Blood cultures were obtained on _%#MMDD2003#%_ given the fact that he had a Foley catheter.
2025-05-05 10:49:44,432 - WARNING - Could not find short form 'C&S' in context: LABORATORY  DATA CBC normal. Dilantin level is subtherapeutic at less than 3. Liver function test normal. Albumin 4.2.

2025-05-05 10:49:44,433 - WARNING - Could not find short form 'C&S' in context: PAST  MEDICAL HISTORY a. Hypercoagulable workup at that time was negative. This included normal antithrombin III, negative factor V Leiden, negative prothrombin mutation negative lupus inhibitor. Normal homocystine. Normal ANA. Normal protein C&S. studies. b. MRI/MRA of the brain showed proximal stenosis of the vertebral arteries bilaterally as well as distally at both vertebral arteries and the basilar artery secondary to her atherosclerosis versus fibromuscular dysplasia or vasculitis unchanged compared with _%#MMDD1999#%_ and acute infarct in the left lateral and posterior temporal lobe, left lateral occipital lobe, probably in the distribution of the left posterior cerebral artery and posterior temporal branch.
2025-05-05 10:49:44,438 - WARNING - Could not find short form 'C&S' in context: BRIEF HISTORY AND HOSPITAL COURSE Interestingly, her baseline APTT is normal. She was started on 75 mg of Lovenox subq q.12h and was started on Coumadin per protocol. A homocysteine level, anticardiolipin, Factor V Leiden and lupus inhibitor was obtained. Protein C&S was not able because she was already given a dose of Lovenox. She remained otherwise hemodynamically stable and on the day prior to discharge was ambulatory in the hallways with little dyspnea or chest pain.
2025-05-05 10:49:44,438 - WARNING - Could not find short form 'C&S' in context: ALLERGIES A hypercoagulable panel was drawn to evaluate for any hypercoagulable disease state. These included factor V Leiden, activated protein C, protein C&S, homocysteine, antithrombin III, G20210A mutation, lupus inhibitor, and anticardiolipin antibody. These are unlikely to reveal any positive findings, but should be followed up as an outpatient.
2025-05-05 10:49:44,438 - WARNING - Could not find short form 'C&S' in context: ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS I would check a factor V Leiden, a factor 2 mutation, and lupus anticoagulant when she is off anticoagulation. A factor C and protein C&S can be checked. I would recommend Lovenox 1 mg/kg b.i.d. for 6 weeks. The duration of anticoagulation can be prolonged. If any of the above factors are positive or she can be on a prophylactic dose of Lovenox after the six weeks if the above factors are positive.
